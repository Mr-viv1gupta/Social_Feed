INTRODUCTION
------------

 - Social Feed module provides the user to fetch feeds from their respective
 Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram profiles and then display them using the Drupal 
 block system according to the requirements.

 - Facebook APIs will allow you to display particular post types,
 pictures, videos of your posts and feeds also the date of your post with
 provision to provide number of count and reaction to the Post.


 - Instagram APIs will allow you to display pictures from your
 instagram profile with provision to provide number of count to be displayed
 also provision to select the resolution of the image with options and you can
 also provide the post link and rection to the post.

 - Twitter APIs will allow you get the latest tweets with date
 of your format and provision to provide number of count. Twitter APIs will
 not work locally but only on live sites as RSS feeds.

 - This module is highly recommended for the both developers & non-developers
 since the default layout of the blocks are plain and in simple text hence if
 you're aware of working with CSS then this module will work for you like a
 charm.
